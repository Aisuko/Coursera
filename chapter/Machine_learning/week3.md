# Classification and Representation

## Classification
* To attempt classification, one method is to use linear regression and map all predictions greater than 0.5 as a 1 and all less than a0.
* This method doesn't work well because classification is not actually a linear function.

## Hypothesis Representation
* Logistic Regression Model(函数g())
  * Sigmoid function
  * Logistic function
* `假设函数(0.7=P(y=1|x;theta)` --给定特性x,y等1的概率的参数是theta
